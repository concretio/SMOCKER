## Smock-It Commands

1. **Initialize Template**: This command initializes a new data generation template. It sets up the required directory structure, prompts for a valid template file name, and collects configuration details for Salesforce objects (such as fields to exclude and record counts). The configuration is validated against org before it is saved to a JSON file.

   ```bash
   sf template init [--default]
   ```
2. **Upsert Configurations**: This command allows users to add or update configuration settings in an existing data template. Users can specify options like the Salesforce object, language, record count, fields to exclude, and other settings. 
If the object is not already present, the command will prompt users to add it.

   ```bash
   sf template upsert -t <templateFileName> [-s <sObject>] [-l <languageCode>] [-c <recordCount>] [-x <namespaceToExclude>] [-f <outputFormat>] [-e <fieldsToExclude>]
   ```
3. **Remove Configurations**: This command allows users to remove specific configurations from an existing data template. It can remove settings like record count, language, namespaces, output format, and fields to exclude.However record count and language cannot be removed globally, and at least one output format is required.
   ```bash
   sf template remove -t <templateFileName> [-s <sObject>] [-l <languageCode>] [-c <recordCount>] [-x <namespaceToExclude>] [-f <outputFormat>] [-e <fieldsToExclude>]
   ```
4. **Validate Template**: This command validates a data generation template file, ensuring that it is correctly configured for Salesforce. It checks the template for correctness, connects to Salesforce (using environment variables for credentials), and logs any warnings or errors found in the template's configuration. This step ensures that all objects, fields, and settings are properly defined before use.

   ```bash
   sf template validate -t <templateFileName>
   ```
5. **Generate Data**: The generate command reads a Salesforce data generation template and generates data based on the objects and settings defined within it. It also excludes the  fields from the data template file that have been specified, ensuring that unwanted fields are omitted from the generated records. This command is designed to facilitate the creation of tailored datasets for Salesforce objects.

   ```bash
   sf data generate -t <templateFileName>
   ```
